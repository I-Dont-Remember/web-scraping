# itbooks

Grabbing a large number of free ebooks from the interwebz in case the site ever goes down
when I want books.  
  
Unfortunately this project stalled as soon as I had acquired them all and began figuring out what
to do with them.  My happy little windows-xp-home-computer-turned-NFS-server of only a few
weeks decided it was time to go belly up.  Currently trying to remedy this situation and 
scrounge up another free server, preferably one with drives under 11 years old.
